# Computer Vision RPS

> Include here a brief description of the project, what technologies are used etc.
> Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera. A machine learning model is used to train it to recognising the users input and Python to code the program. 

## Milestone 1: Set up the enviroment

- Prerequisites for the task:
1. Operating Systems
2. What is the command line
3. File Navigation & File Paths
4. Git and Version Control
5. Commits and Branches
6. What is Github?
7. File Manipulation
- Task 1: Set up GitHub. 

- Answer some of these questions in the next few bullet points. What have you built? What technologies have you used? Why have you used those?

- Example: The FastAPI framework allows for fast and easy construction of APIs and is combined with pydantic, which is used to assert the data types of all incoming data to allow for easier processing later on. The server is ran locally using uvicorn, a library for ASGI server implementation.
  
```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

## Milestone 2: Create the computer vision system

- Milestone 2 continues from Milestone 1. A computer vision system (a model) is used to detect the user input of either Nothing, Rock, Paper or Scissors to the camera. The keras_model.h5 and labels.txt files are downloaded. GitHub repository is updated.

- Task 1: Create an image project model with four different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing. Use 'Techable-MAchine' to create model.
- Task 2: Download the model. This is done from the 'Tensorflow' tab in 'Techable-Machine'.  Keras_model.h5 and labels.txt saved. GitHub updated.
- Task 3: Begin documenting your experience. README.md file updated and GitHub updated.

- Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

- Example below:

```bash
/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181
```

- The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:

```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

## Milestone n

- Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

- Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

## Conclusions

- Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.

- Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive?
